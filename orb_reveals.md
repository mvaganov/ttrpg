>! `perception` DC15: it looks like Liam and Cinerous, except Cinerous has different clothes. Liam bows courtiously while holding his hands up. Cinerous stares at the party intensly, at Vancient in particular, with his hands up, preparing to be judged.

>! `perception` DC20: it looks exactly like Liam, and Cinerous has a different robe and a crown.

>! `perception` DC25: it looks almost exactly like Liam, though the hair is a little bit different, and Cinerous wears a white robe (`spellcraft` 30: robe of the good archmagi), has 5 scroll cases, and a glowing silver laurel on his head (`perception` 40 and `spellcraft` DC 40: crown of mental prowess, probably intelligence and wisdom +6).

>! `perception` DC30: Future Liam appears older. subtle deepening of crows feet and laugh lines around his face. He's groomed and clothed as if intentionally to match present Liam. Both Cinerous and Liam wear mundane backpacks instead of a bag of holding.

>! `Sense Motive` DC20: both Future Cinerous and Future Liam comport themselves honestly and directly, as if they don't have a lot of time to spare.

>! `Sense Motive` DC25: Liam has the same mannerisms that makes him such an effective speaker. He speaks calmly and clearly, with a rehearsed quality, making it hard to know if he's adlibbing or speaking from a well memorized script.

>! `Sense Motive` DC30: Both Future Liam and Future Cinerous are very believable. If these are dopplegangers, they have really done their homework. Liam's words have that same hint of "I've got a secret, and I can't tell" that makes his diplomacy so enrapturing. Future Cinerous is classic Cinerous, looking like he's fed up with this situation, and anyone could set him off, and he's intentionally trying to keep himself cool.

**Future Cinerous**: Hello. We are from the future. From a judicial perspective, you may lawfully treat us as uncontrolled outsiders, as established by the precident of TVA v. McFly, Axis docket 1955.10.05-88A.

>! `Sense Motive` DC10: that sounds convoluted.

>! `Sense Motive` DC30: seems legit.

>! `knowledge planes` DC35: Axis does have laws which stem from rulings judged by axiomites. Cinerous may know some of the details of TVA v. McFly

>! `knowledge planes` and `knowledge history` DC35: of course. the case where a human boy travelled back in time to try to save his wizard friend from dying, and accidentally destroyed his own timeline. It was successfully argued that meddling outsiders alter reality all the time, and the rule of 3 is a fair rule to apply to time travellers. Because the boy's most significant changes to the time line were less than 3 in number, and he made a good-faith effort to undo his changes, he was released, and retroactively allowed to maintain his altered timelines.

**Future Liam**: "Dromar'Ayfex, I am not here to change the timeline, I humbly request you allow us use of the Soul Dreamer once, to possibly save my timeline, including a future version of you. Your own redemption relies on raising up heros, and here I stand, a proof of your path of redemption. I humbly beseach you, allow us, Future Liam and Future Cinerous, the next use of Lor Faer Gaud. In exchange, Future Cinerous and I will explain how to use the tool safely and wisely to these younger heroes. Is that agreeable?

>! `Knowledge (arcana)` DC25, Liam and Keldan can use their +2 Super Cognition of the Wurm - all dragons consider it dirty to intervene in mortal affairs directly, and conversely, it is most noble to do great deeds using other mortals as tools. Liam's tone implies he is acting as such: a tool of Dromar from the future, and Dromar of the present.

>! `Sense Motive` DC30: future Liam is clearly establishing a verbal contract, and implying everyone present is a witness. The legal context is explicitly clear to Dromar.

Analysis on Future Liam or Future Cinerous:

>! `spellcraft` DC29: Liam/Cinerous is under the effect of a 9th level divination spell.

**Future Liam**: "Also, in accordance with the outsider-prime-material-directives, I assert my right to grant prime-material natives up to 3 boons natural to my being and skills. As a natural human diplomat, my boon is mundane communication. Three sentences. If there any objections, please speak quickly, our time is limited."

>! if anyone asks why their time is limited, Future Cinerous will respond: "Limitations on reliable time travel. Elaboration could put you all at risk of a violation of the outsider-prime-material-directives, and a potentially more serious Breach of Fate."

**Future Cinerous**: "My boons, as a legal expert of Axis, have already been utilized in the strict review of this planned interaction, and your (Dromar's) subsequent absolution of culpability in potential insider dealing with outsiders."
	
**Future Cinerous** hands Dromar a signed legal form: "Everything should be in order." Forms XPI104r (Extra Planar Interaction request) and XP104w (Extra Planar Interaction witness): "Could you please sign these two as a representative of the parties present, and these copies as well."

>! `knowledge (nobility)` DC20: Future Cinerous and future Liam clearly planned to be exactly here, and exactly now. These legal documents notorize this encounter as free, .

>! `Knowledge (planes)` DC20: there are rules about what extra-planar beings are allowed to do on the prime-material plane according to Axis. These are not always enforceable, but enforceable enough, with inhibiting enough consequences, that the most powerful beings from the Planes prefer not to run amock in the prime material planes. The signed forms give such beings legal cover, along with primes they interact with.

>! `Knowledge (planes)` DC25: Having a Lawful metallic dragon significantly increases the risk of legal jeopardy associated with extra-planar laws, and is probably what is warranting the contractual language.

>! `Knowledge (planes)` DC30: the 3 boons clause does not allow do-overs. if the boons are ephemeral, you better pay attention, and record them if possible. Present Cinerous will probably pull out his notebook and start taking notes.

>! `Sense Motive` DC20: Future Cinerous nods at Present Cinerous, and appears to relax a little, compared to when he showed up.

**Future Liam**: While dromar fills out those forms, I'll get to my three boons:

>! `perception` DC15: As Liam speaks, he gently unwraps a soul orb from what appears to be subtly glowing cloth of some kind)

**Future Liam**: 1: Try to be Heyori's best friend, because with his best advice you don't need time-traveller knowledge.

>! `Sense motive` DC10: Future Liam gives a long pause after his first sentence, expecting everyone to commit it to memory or take notes

**Future Liam**: 2: Get *Rezvir* to talk a about the craftsman of the tower and take a broken tool of his from the dungeon refuse pile.

>! `Sense motive` DC10: Future Liam over-annunciate's the name, and gestures as though striking and "scraping" the soul orb with a mimed tiny pick

**Future Liam**: 3: Spellcraft the sphere workshop to "nathani" while *expertly sculpting* during the golem fight, after accepting the curse inside.

>! `Sense motive` DC10: Liam walks his fingers around the soul orb, then mimes sculpting the sphere as though it were clay while over-annunciating "sculpting"

>! `knowledge (history)` or `linguistics` DC10: nathani is *HELP* in Elvish)

**Future Liam** bows to Future Cinerous, who has moved to the glowing metal sphere that seemed to regurgitate Dromar moments earlier

**Future Cinerous**: the following exposition is not strictly future knowledge, and is in accordance with all of the lesser prophet and diviner exemption clauses. I testify as a member of Axis Law Enforcement that the following knowledge is derivable through sub-paragon-level divine intervention, and mundane analysis, including repeatable testing.

**Future Liam** speaks a command word "olor", and the sphere opens into 4 small floating shields, dropping a glowing white blanket to the ground. It seems to magically resize itself as Liam pulls it around himself.

>! `linguistics` DC15: "Olor" means dream in Elvish.

>! `perception` DC15: Liam covers himself with the blanket and lies down. seconds later, the mass of the blanket is sucked into the void between the 4 small shields, and the sphere closes.

**Future Cinerous**: Listen up kids because this is important, and I have to be brief for a lot of reasons.

>! `perception` DC20: as Future Cinerous is talking, he is flipping through a notebook, very much like the one Present-Cinerous is writing notes in.

>! `perception` DC25: The notebook is newer and smaller than what present Cinerous is writing in.

**Future Cinerous**: "LÃ³r Faer Gaud" The Soul Dream Device --or SoulDreamer, is this hovering sphere. Actually it's 4 sheild-like curves that fit perfectly into a sphere. 

**Future Cinerous**: A dreamer, the creature who covers themselves in the blanket, will fall into a deep sleep, and be absorbed into the sphere.
**Future Cinerous** touches the sphere and pauses for a moment. Then he pours a pretty good amount of diamond dust over the sphere.

>! `Spellcraft` DC20: Cinerous is apparently giving the sphere commands telepathically.

>! `Appraise` DC10: it looks like much more than 500gp worth of diamond dust

>! `Appraise` DC20: it looks like more than 2500gp worth of diamond dust, though maybe not much more

**Future Cinerous**: A dream weilder instructs the sphere, using spellcraft and knowledge, to induce a specific dream for the dreamer. The diamond dust is a material cost used by the sphere internally. Just a moment.
(Future Cinerous reads from the notebook, and casts some spells into the sphere.

>! `Spellcraft` DC17: secret sign
		https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/secret-sign/

>! `Spellcraft` DC20: permenancy

>! `Spellcraft` DC25: some kind of polymorph druid spell from a scroll

>! OR MAYBE `Spellcraft` DC30: with the target being a 'celestial human'

>! `Spellcraft` DC20: permenancy again

>! `Spellcraft` DC16: preserve https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/preserve/ from a scroll

>! `Spellcraft` DC20: another permenancy --from a scroll

>! `Spellcraft` perception DC20 + `Spellcraft` DC20: Future Cinerous activated a magical property of a ring he is wearing

**Future Cinerous**: Entering the sphere causes the dreamer's soul to enter a dream-reality described during instruction, by the dream weilder. The reality is an actual reality, with laws of physics and magic consistent with our own source reality. The dream is actually a mindscape-controlled meta-pocket-dimension, using a variably scaled time rate, created exclusively for the dreamer's soul.

>! `Spellcraft` DC19 https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-mindscape/

**Future Cinerous**: Though the dream lasts for mere moments in the prime material plane, it can convey entire new realities, histories of hundreds of years, and entire lives-lived to the dreamer.

>! `Sense motive` DC20: Future Cinerous has definitely done this 'reality crafting' thing with the sphere before.

**Future Cinerous**: Waking from the dream leaves memories and skills from the dream in the body of the dreamer. This allows dreamers to practice skills, feats, known spells, and other learned abilities, retraining in specific ways with little regard to time passing in reality. The dreamer's living soul is permenantly changed by the dream. This is a necromantic effect, sort of like an inverted-recorporeal incarceration. Think on that later. (Future Cinerous looks directly at Present Cinerous when making that comment)

>! `Spellcraft` DC22 https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/recorporeal-incarnation/

**Future Cinerous**: A pre-instructed dream, which doesn't need a dream weilder to operate, takes minutes (1+1d6) to finish, and 100gp of diamond dust of material cost. After the dream, the sphere re-opens, releasing the dreamer, who emerges awake and rested, as long as they were alive when they entered. A very skilled spellcraft (DC20) allows the dream weilder to make small character changes to the dreamer, which can be the same person who pre-instructed the dream.
	
> small character change: re-allocating skills (up to int-modifier), changing a feat, or trait, or a class ability, or alignment one step.

A hard-to-imagine feat of spellcraft (DC40) could be used to get the Soul Dream Device to do two of those changes at once (costing double diamond dust). A basically impossible (DC60) spellcraft would allow for three (costing triple diamond dust). Failing the check ends the dream prematurely in an unspecific nightmare, and soul damage (1 negative level for the dreamer). The Soul Dream Device can also react negatively to a nightmare. I'll get to that in a few moments.

(the rest of the exposition takes Future Cinerous several minutes to do, during which he is constantly checking his notes, performing spellcraft into the device, and visibly thinking hard)

>! `sense motive` DC25: Cinerous is ecstatic. something very good happened while he was using the device, and he is trying not to think about it. 

>! `sense motive` DC30: Cinerous is trying very hard not to be ecstatic because he is self-concious abount being watched by Vancient and Cinerous, who are both suspicious of excitable monologuing characters.

**Future Cinerous**: Using the device more than once per creature per day will result in irreperable mental and spiritual damage to the dreamer, along the lines of a permanent feeblemind spell, requiring a Wish to undo. Souls are supple yet unelastic, and don't respond well to repeated restructuring without rest periods.

>! `sense motive` DC30: Cinerous gives Dromar a glance, who looks down, possibly showing signs of guilt.

**Future Cinerous**: If another person controls the sphere during the dream, a Dream Weilder, an entire lifetime can be simulated, guided by the konwledge of the dream weilder. It takes many minutes to finish such a dream, based on the soul of the dreamer (1d6 minutes per level changed, 250gp of diamond dust per level changed). I have spent time crafting a new history for the Liam from my timeline (a craft check using knowledge (history) DC20 + number-of-levels-to-change. The crafting cost-in-silver to determine how long it takes to make the new history is 1000 * number-of-levels-to-change. Normal crafting rules are: a week of crafting progress is YouCraftCheck * CraftCheckDC, which subtracts from the cost-in-silver).

**Future Cinerous**: The dream weilder can simulate an entire life if they are very skilled at Spellcraft (DC20 to start) and many other essentially random kinds of knowledge (multiple random skilled knowledge checks DC20, as many as levels that are being simulated). The skilled knowledge checks can be made easier (DC -5) by using a special automatic feature of the Dream Device which requires an exceedingly difficult knowledge of planes (DC30) to activate. You should always use this feature. Full-life simulation allows the dreamer to change any part of their character advancement from the beginning of their life to their present. If all goes well.

**Future Cinerous**: If the dream weilder fails a skill check while simulating an entire life, the error cascades the dream into an unspecific nightmare. In the case of a nightmare, the entire dream should be aborted by the dream weilder, for the safety of the dreamer and everyone around the Soul Dream Device. In a nightmare situation, the device can channel a reality-distortion pulse that can distort memories sentient creatures nearby. Significant-but-restorable soul damage occurs to the aborted dreamer regardless (a negative level for each level the dream weilder attempted to replace).

>! `intelligence` DC20: it's possible that when Dromar used the sphere, it triggered a reality-distortion pulse.

**Future Cinerous**: Placing a soul-orb into the sphere with the dreamer will "catch" partial elements of a dreamer's current soul as it is pushed out and replaced during the dream. The soul orb can then be used to recover the old soul, as though the character could swap personalities. You are right about that interaction Dromar.

>! `sense motive` DC35: dromar appears pleased, though he is intentionally aloof to the comment. That sort of intentional humility is very common in metalic dagons, and rare in chromatic ones.

**Future Cinerous**: An awakened dreamer permanently maintains the soul created by the Soul Dream Device as though it were natural, an effect that is very confusing to diviners and clairvoyants. The dreamer can switch back to their old soul by synchronizing with a soul-orb containing their old soul fragments. Synchronization requires simple uninterrupted meditation for about one minute (as 10 full-round actions), which will swap the contents of the soul orb within the dreamer's body, as though a permanent magic-jar occured. Once the souls find resonance the swap is natural and instantaneous. Interruption of soul swapping meditation does not harm either soul, though there is always risk of unspecified memory warp due to exposure of the soul in the soul orb to background necrotic magic.

>! `sense motive` DC10: cinerous is serious about memory warp.

**Future Cinerous**: Souls in the soul orb are actually incomplete soul fragments, only able to swap with their original owner. The incomplete souls are not alive, and do not have the capacity to recognize imprisonment, and are also not complete enough to replace a dead soul. An incomplete soul *can* be used by a living clone, or some other alternate-version of the original dreamer. For safest soul storage, empty the soul orb with greater-dispel-magic before the dream begins. Keep soul orbs covered in ghost-touch cloth, or stored in a soul-sterile demi-plane, like an empty bag of holding, to avoid contamination from spiritual and necrotic energies. Even exposure to an active Arudion can impact the partial soul in a soul orb. It is possible that a corrupted soul orb will derange or degenerate the character of the soul it holds.

>! `sense motive` DC10: cinerous is deadly serious about necrotic energy corrupting a soul in a soul orb.

**Future Cinerous**: Do not let just anyone craft dreams with the device, keep the dream weilders disciplined and benevolent (Lawful Good), especially for full life simulations. Every time a dream weilder crafts a dream, parts of the dream weilder's knowledge and temperment imprint into the Sould Dream Device, changing the nature of the device. If a chaotic or evil dream weilder uses the device, it will degenerate the consistency of dreams, increasing the difficulty of crafting future dreams (cumulative +1 to all future difficulty DCs), which will probably harm dreamers. Again, if you want to keep using it, please, keep the SoulDreamer, and soul orbs, away from chaotic and evil energies.

>! `sense motive` DC35: Cinerous stops himself from saying more.

**Future Cinerous**: Every time a soul-orb user swaps their souls, they warp some memories. The warp is inevitable and insidious because it is imperceptable. Avoid soul-swapping in general, if you can. The more like your current life your new soul is, the less memory warp you will experience.

>! `sense motive` DC30: Cinerous seems confident in the device's effectiveness, but opposed to using the device on himself.

**Future Cinerous**: Also, dying during the dream means dying in the prime material plane as well. A dead creature arrives dead in the prime material plane when the dream ends, but only just recently, and can be revived with a timely Breath of Life. Death in the dream ends the dream, so it doesn't make sense to try to revive the dreamer while they are still within the Soul Dream Device.

>! `sense motive` DC20: Cinerous has been monitoring the dream, and appears to be triggered by something happening in the dream.

**Future Cinerous**: I need another moment for this next part, please hold. **Future Cinerous** casts more spells:

>! `spellcraft` DC18 stolen light https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stolen-light

>! `spellcraft` DC19 soul vault https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/soul-vault/ from a scroll

>! `spellcraft` DC20 3 permenancies https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/permanency/ , all from scrolls

**Future Cinerous**: The soul weilder can cast spells on the dreamer without paying all material costs, since those can actually be provided in the dream world. The weilder can also control random spell consequences, and have those spells continue to effect the dreamer when they emerge. This notably includes permanency, many kinds of wish, change race, and illusion spells with lasting effects. Spells from scrolls and some magic item effects can transfer into the dream with an exceedingly difficult spellcraft (DC30). Interestingly, permanencied spells can follow the swapped soul instead of the body, but not always. Some spells are permanent to the body, others to the soul, and it's possible for permanencied spells to switch where they are bound. It's even possible for permanencied spells from the dream to fade randomly. The logic for how permanent spell work is unclear, and seemingly inconsistent.

**Future Cinerous** touches a few objects in his backpack, and looks back up): We still have some time.

>! `perception` DC40: cinerous appears to have over a dozen glass orbs in his bag, each smaller than a small apple, with colored swirls of magical energy inside)

**Future Cinerous**: You can and should Legend-lore the Soul Dream Device. It will reveal that it was crafted many millenia ago, by the original Elven race of Mellondor, when elves consorted with the Axiomites, before the dark-elven schism. It played a role as an education and experimentation tool, used by the long forgotten elites of an ancient society. Few records of the civilization exist, even in the Axis archives.

>! `sense motive` DC20: Future Cinerous is hinting that there is a lot of valuable information about early Mellondor in the Axis archives, and the party should seek it out.

**Future Cinerous**: There were very few of these devices made, though the few that existed were very important. Nearly all were destroyed as high-value targets during an ancient race war between dragons and elves. This one was a scarcely used prototype, captured early in the war, and hidden by a long forgotten dragon who wanted it for his hoard. It was obfuscated in many different ways to keep it hidden, and unable to be used. The artifact was eventually forgotten by the dragons, and traded as merely a rare bauble in negotiated treasure exchanges.

>! `sense motive` DC40: Future Cinerous knows more about who crafted the orbs, but isn't saying, probably because he doesn't want to side track the conversation.

**Future Cinerous**: This orb's loss was inevitable becaue of powerful magics used to hide it. Several millenia after the Dark Elven schism, Dark-Elves found the Soul Dream Device, and unravelled many draconic spells of obfuscation, but they did not uncover its true nature then. Then again, the device vanished through neglect and persistent magical obfuscations. The house of Vecna discovered the device while searching for hidden and forbidden knowledge, and contracted Dromar to help unravel the last obfuscations. He succeeded after many decades, not long after the house of Vecna was destroyed, finally laying bare much of it's history, and much of the usage details.

>! `sense motive` DC30: Dromar isn't surprised by anything Cinerous has said, and is probably using this exposition as proof that Future Liam and Future Cinerous truly are who they say they are.

**Future Cinerous**: In the many decades since Dromar discovered it's use, he became preoccupied with politics and propigating violence through minions, letting personal experiments sit idle. Dromar has only recently started experimenting with it on sentient creatures again, and thankfully for us, was cautious enough to avoid simulating an entire lifetime himself.

>! `sense motive` DC20: Cinerous is speaking very carefully, trying to hold back information that might break rules.

>! `sense motive` DC30: there are details about using the device to simulate lifetimes that Cinerous is intentionally not going into.

>! `sense motive` DC40: he has things he wishes he could elaborate on, related to his present goals, but he won't out of a sense of duty and justice.

**Cinerous**: ... And we're about done here.
