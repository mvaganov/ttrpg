## Arudion, Lesser
**School** Necromancy; **Level** magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1
### Casting
**Casting Time** 1 minute
**Components** V, S, M (a small rigid non-metal and inanimate object, life-essence of a living creature like blood/sweat/tears, AND one gold coin)
### Effect
**Range** personal, see text
**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object
**Duration** 1 hour per caster level (D)
### Description
An Arudion is a rigid non-metal inanimate object (a pebble, piece of wood, stiff paper, ...), imbued with a shadow of life, which is enslaved into the rigid medium by magically etched gold runes. The Arudion is programmed by these runes during casting.
A programmed Arudion can activated with a carefully worded contingency. Easily programmed contingencies include a command-word or physical pressing or swiping.
A simple describable event can be used as a trigger, with failure chance at GM discretion. Arudions can be linked together during programming, which allows them trigger other physically linked Arudions. These triggers have a delay up to GM discretion.
Arudion functionality can be augmented by including additional resources when crafting the spell:

* emit light (as light cantrip) (requires a gem valued at 5gp or more)
* emit sound (as ghost sound) (requires an additional gold coin)
* vibrate gently in specific patterns (requires an additional gold coin)
* ability to link to other Arudions with a wire or string (requires an additional gold coin)
* wireless link (5gp gem: short range link (25ft + 2ft per 2 casterlevels), 25gp gem: medium range link (100ft + 10ft per caster level), 100gp gem: long range link (400ft + 40ft per level)). The wireless signal that communicates between Arudions can be blocked by a metal box, and could fail if many other Arudions are messaging each other simultaneously, at the discretion of the GM. 

A finished Arudion made of minimal materials has 1 hitpoint, and ceases to function after it loses that hitpoint from damage. An Arudion can be made permanent with Permenancy. An expired (but not destroyed or broken) Arudion whose duration has finished can have it's duration restarted by casting Lesser Arudion into it, ignoring material component costs.

## Analyze Spell Cast
**School** Divination; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1
### Casting
**Casting Time** standard action
**Components** V, S, M (1 gp diamond dust)
### Effect
**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)
**Target** a source of magic or spell effect
**Duration** instantaneous
**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no
### Description
Analyze Spell Cast Determines the spell level of a persistent spell (within 1d4 levels), possibly the alignment of the caster, how long ago the spell was cast (by category: less than 1 minute, less than 1 day, less than one month, less than one year, or power-of-10 years). Works on magical items. Probably written by House of Vecna.

## Data Breach
**School** Divination; **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2
### Casting
**Casting Time** 1 minute
**Components** V, S, M (1 gp diamond dust)
### Effect
**Range** touch
**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object
**Duration** 1 round per level
**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes
### Description
Creates a 'divination hole' emminating from a finger-print sized portion of the object touched. The hole emits a bright magical light visible with any divination spell, including level 0 cantrips/orisons. The light shines and 'vibrates' in a way that allows scrying and divination to tunnel through magical fields that would otherwise prevent scrying. Any basic divination done while looking at the divination-hole (by the caster of the divination hole) automatically succeeds any caster-level checks, allowing at least partial truth to be discerned (like spell school, when a spell was cast, what kind of caster cast the spell, an estimate of spell duration), even from deep obfuscating magics.

## Arcane Collaboration
**School** Abjuration; **Level** bard 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2
### Casting
**Casting Time** 10 minutes
**Components** V, S
### Effect
**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level), medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
**Target** up to 1 + 1 / 3 levels friendly targets
**Duration** 1 hour per level (D)
**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no
### Description
This spell allows the caster to share control of a spell to up to 1 + lvl/3 other casters with sufficiently high casting scores. The effect lasts 1hr per level, or until the shared spell expires.

## Mage Clamps
**School** Transmutation; **Level** bard 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2
### Casting
**Casting Time** 1 round
**Components** V, S
### Effect
**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
**Target** one non-magical, unattended object weighing up to 5 lbs. per 3 caster levels (max 5)
**Duration** 1 hour per caster level
**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no
### Description
The caster creates multiple mage hands, which persist without concentration, though they will wink out of existence if the caster moves beyond the spell range or falls unconscious. Each hand can be moved manually, one hand per round, as a normal magehand. In addition, each hand can be automated to do repetative motions that the caster is practiced at doing, and trusted to do those tasks exactly as the caster would do them, as if controlled directly with no sensory feedback. Automated hands are not coordinated enough to make an attack, but could easily be used to assist in holding objects still, be set in motion to trigger a trap, or perform other repetative manual tasks like scrubbing or simple repetative craft work. If used for crafting, this spell can circumstantially add up to +1 to the craft check for every 3 caster levels (max +6) as an aid-another assistance bonus (does not stack with other sources of aid another).

## Arudion
**School** Necromancy; **Level** bard 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3
### Casting
**Casting Time** 10 minutes
**Components** V, S, M (a small rigid non-metal and inanimate object, life-essence of a living creature, 5 gold coins, and possibly more)
### Effect
**Range** personal, see text
**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object
**Duration** 1 hour per caster level (D)
### Description
As Lesser Arudion, with the following additions:
* If minimal in size: 5 hitpoints
* Can be made permanent as if it were a level 1 spell
* Linked range augmentation from the Lesser Arudion, typically measured in feet, is measured in miles instead.
* The Adurion can be triggered by a visible gesture (within line of sight) without fail (requires an additional gold coin)
* The Arudion can be programmed to press itself with the force of a mage hand, allowing it to move (roll or slide) under its own power at 15 feet per round, as long as that motion would not cause the Arudion to levitate. A linked Arudion triggered from a distance can only apply 1 lb of force once per round, or roll the Arudion at 5ft per round. (requires a gem valued at 25gp or more)
* A linked Arudion can hear, poorly, through another Arudion (add +5 circumstance penalty to hear through linked Arudions) (requires a gem valued at 25gp or more)
* A linked Arudion can project hazy black-and-gray outlines on the Arudion's surface, allowing the user to 'see' through the other Arudion, poorly, with a sight range of 5ft (add a +10 circumstance penelty to see through linked Arudions). (requires a gem valued at 25gp or more)
* Arudions can be used as a source for a scry sensor without need for a scry roll, though any obstructing magic will affect the scry as normal. (requires a gem valued at 10gp or more)

## Detect Dimensional Wake
**School** Divination; **Level** bard 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3
### Casting
**Casting Time** 1 round
**Components** V, S
### Effect
**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)
**Target** a recent teleportation effect
**Duration** instantaneous (D)
### Description
Detect Dimensional Wake can determine what direction a teleport, dimension-door, or similar effect is headed toward, and the general range of the effect as an order-of-magnitude (as determined by the teleportation mischance table). The teleportation being analyzed needs to have started or ended within caster-level rounds, within the spell range.

---
## Area Channel
**School** Transmutation; **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4
### Casting
**Casting Time** 1 minute per 5ft (D)
**Components** V, S, MF (Metal 1-inch diameter "channeling pipes")
### Effect
**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level), medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object
**Duration** 1 day per level (D)
### Description
Area Channel uses metal Chanelling Pipes to change the shape of an area-of-effect spell that effects a cubic-feet, cone, cylinder, or radius (spherical) emenation. Channeling Pipes must be of masterwork quality (100gp per 5ft), contiguously connected, with at least one source within the original area of effect. The type of spell effect being channeled must be specified when Area Channel is cast. The channeling pipe redistributes spell volume from the main emenation in 5ft cubed increments, to create a 5 cubic-ft cylinder of the target spell around or inside the pipe. The volume of the new emenation is subtracted from the original volume of the spell till all the volume is used, with excess spilling out uncontrolled evenly between the pipe exits. This can be used to turn a fireball into a line of fire up to 251 5ft-cubes long.

## Teleportation Trace
**School** Divination; **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 5
### Casting
**Casting Time** 1 round
**Components** V, S, M (a stone, coin, or other small rigid and inanimate object)
### Effect
**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)
**Target** a recent teleportation effect
**Duration** 1 minute per level, instantaneous (D)
### Description
Teleportation Trace allows the caster to monitor teleporations in close range for 1 minute per level, as Detect Dimensional Wake. Addtionally, the caster can scry for 1 round to the point where a teleportation has started or ended. The teleportation being analyzed needs to have happened within caster-level rounds, within the range of the spell.

## Metalshape
**School** Transmutation; **Level** bard 6, magus 6, sorcerer/wizard 6
### Casting
**Casting Time** 10 minutes
**Components** V, S, M (a stone, coin, or other small rigid and inanimate object)
### Effect
**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level), medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object
**Duration** instantaneous or concentration up to 10 rounds. (D)
### Description
Metalshape functions as 10 consecutive rounds of stoneshape. It can also modify metal by dividing the amount shaped by 10. The spell can create fine details, including fine moving parts, contingent on an appropriate craft check (blacksmithing, sculpture, stonework, clockwork, ...). This spell can do 8 hours of appropriate crafting with stone or metal in the full 10 round duration. 8 hours of crafting can be hurried to less than 10 rounds to a minimum of 1 round by adding 5 to the craft DC for every skipped round. This effectively enables an entire day of crafting to be done in 5 rounds with a craft DC increase of +25, or *instantly* with a craft DC increase of +50.

## Tenacious Enigma
**School** Abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7
### Casting
**Casting Time** standard action
**Components** V, S
### Effect
**Range** see description
**Target** see description
**Duration** see description
### Description
Tenacious Enigma automatically re-applies a duration spell X number of times in sequence, where X is up to 1/4 caster level. This spell is designed to function with spells that can be made permanent with Permenancy, as well as illusion spells, abjuration spells, and mage's private sanctum. Each re-application is cast into a spell *cache* at the caster's convenience, using any metamagic feats or up-castings wished by the caster as normal. Tenacious Enigma automatically triggers cached castings, as though by a contingency spell, once the original duration is finished, or the original spell is dispelled. Instead of automatically reapplying after duration, subsequent spell castings can be set for rounds, minutes, days, or even decades after the previous casting expired (though not centuries). Any material costs associated with repeated spell casting must be paid when Tenacious Enigma is cast, along with the required spell castings themselves. Spells that require concentration will only function if the caster is present.

## Falsify Legend Lore
**School** Illusion; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7
### Casting
**Casting Time** 10 minutes
**Components** V, S, M (a stone, coin, or other small rigid and inanimate object)
### Effect
**Range** Unlimited
**Target** a subject
**Duration** 1 hour per level (D)
### Description
Permenantly causes Legend Lore or any other lower-level divination spell to return false information and false histories about the subject. Can be dispelled with another Falsify Legend Lore, only if a notable piece of the true history is known.

---
## Teleport Interrogation
**School** Conjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8
### casting
**Casting Time** one full round
**Components** V, S, F (a polished glass prism worth 100gp)
### Effect
**Range** personal
**Target** a teleportation effect that occured days-per-level ago
**Duration** 1 minute per level
### Description
Enables the caster to 'see' the path of teleportation spells, and latch onto a specific path, which becomes the interrogated path. Once the interrogated path is chosen, the caster knows when the path was used, where the teleportation began and ended, and the size category of the subjects who passed through the path (possibly including details about their sillohette). For the duration of the spell, the caster can teleport along the interrogated path once per minute. The interrogated path can be any distance, through temporary or permanent gates, even extra planar. Paths to and through alternate planes are possibly subject to special rules, depending on the planes.

---
## Reality Obfuscation
**School** Abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9
### Casting
**Casting Time** 1 minute
**Components** V, S
### Effect
**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level), medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
**Target** creature, object, or area (5ft/level sphere)
**Duration** 1 day per level (D)
### Description
Reality Obfuscation enchants a subject, an area (5ft-per-level radius sphere) or inanimate object, such that the object, or all objects and characters inside, are un-scryable by magical means. Divination spells made to discern anything inside the field will automatically fail. People who have interacted with the subject, object, or spent time in the field must succeed in a will save or be unable to directly mention the target subject/object(s) while the spell is active. The effect preventing free-expression-of-thought is similar to an attack blocked by a Sanctuary spell. At the end of the spell's duration, anyone familiar with the object, who was not specifically excluded at the time of original casting, must roll a will-save, or permanently lose one step of familiarity with the subject/object(s) (See levels of the Teleport spell table, or 5 DC of the Scrying table). The duration of the spell can be set to less than it's maximum duration on casting.
