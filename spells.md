## Arudion, Lesser

**School** Necromancy; **Level** magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, summoner 1, witch 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (a small rigid non-metal and inanimate object, life-essence of a living creature like blood/sweat/tears, 1 gold coin, see text)

### Effect

**Range** personal, see text

**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object

**Duration** 1 hour per caster level (D)

### Description
An Arudion is a rigid non-metal inanimate object (a pebble, piece of wood, stiff paper, ...), imbued with a shadow of life, which is enslaved into the rigid medium by magically etched gold runes. The Arudion is enchanted to do an action, or "programmed", by runes during casting.
A programmed Arudion can be activated with a carefully worded contingency. Easily programmed contingencies include a command-word, a physical pressing or swiping, or activation of another specific Arudion.
A common use of Arudions is to set up a different trigger for a non-Arudion magical item, which could otherwise be activated by a command word or single action Use Magic Device.

A simple describable event can be used as a trigger, with failure chance at GM discretion. Arudions can be linked together during programming, which allows them trigger other physically or remotely linked Arudions up to a certain range. These triggers have a delay, or "lag", up to GM discretion.
Arudion functionality can be augmented by including additional resources when crafting the spell:

* emit light (as light cantrip) - requires a gem valued at 5gp or more. Light emitted is the color of the gem.
* emit sound (as ghost sound) - requires an additional gold coin.
* vibrate gently in specific patterns - requires an additional gold coin. every second of vibration reduces the duration by an additional second.
* ability to link to other Arudions with a wire or string - requires an additional gold coin
* wireless link - 5gp gem: short range link (25ft + 2ft per 2 casterlevels), 25gp gem: medium range link (100ft + 10ft per caster level), 100gp gem: long range link (400ft + 40ft per level). The wireless signal that communicates between Arudions can be blocked by a metal box, and could fail if many other Arudions are messaging each other simultaneously, at the discretion of the GM. The complexity of the message limits how quickly it can travel wirelessly between Arudions.
instant - the presence or absence of *any* message from *any* Arudion can be determined instantly
1 round - the presence or absense of a message from a specific Arudion
1 round - transmitting the equivalent of 1 word wirelessly
1 minute - transmitting the equivalent of 1 word wirelessly in a way that is difficult for any arudion that is not the intended recipient to detect
Conditions may arise that add additional time cost to messaging per GM discretion.

A finished Arudion made of minimal materials has 1 hitpoint, and ceases to function after it loses that hitpoint from damage. Additional hitpoints are determined by materials used, crafting skill, and GM discretion. An Arudion can be made permanent with Permenancy for 2,500gp. An expired (but not destroyed or broken) Arudion whose duration has finished can have it's duration restarted by casting Lesser Arudion into it, ignoring the initial material component costs.

## Analyze Spell Cast

**School** Divination; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** standard action

**Components** V, S, M (1 gp diamond dust)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Target** a source of magic or spell effect

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description
Analyze Spell Cast Determines the spell level of a persistent spell (within 1d4 levels), possibly the alignment of the caster, how long ago the spell was cast (by category: less than 1 minute, less than 1 day, less than one month, less than one year, or power-of-10 years). Works on magical items.

---
## Data Breach

**School** Divination; **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (1 gp diamond dust)

### Effect

**Range** touch

**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object

**Duration** 1 round per level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description
Creates a 'divination hole' emminating from a finger-print sized portion of the object touched. The hole emits a bright magical light visible with any divination spell, including level 0 cantrips/orisons. The light shines and 'vibrates' in a way that allows scrying and divination to tunnel through magical fields that would otherwise prevent scrying. Any basic divination done while looking at the divination-hole (by the caster of the divination hole) automatically succeeds any caster-level checks, allowing at least partial truth to be discerned (like spell school, when a spell was cast, what kind of caster cast the spell, an estimate of spell duration), even from deep obfuscating magics.

---
## Arcane Collaboration

**School** Abjuration; **Level** bard 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level), medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** up to 1 + 1 / 3 levels friendly targets

**Duration** 1 hour per level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description
This spell allows the caster to share control of a spell to up to 1 + lvl/3 other casters with sufficiently high casting scores. The effect lasts 1hr per level, or until the shared spell expires.

---
## Mage Clamps

**School** Transmutation; **Level** bard 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one non-magical, unattended object weighing up to 5 lbs. per 3 caster levels (max 5)

**Duration** 1 hour per caster level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description
The caster creates multiple mage hands, which persist without concentration, though they will wink out of existence if the caster moves beyond the spell range or falls unconscious. Each hand can be moved manually, one hand per round, as a normal magehand. In addition, each hand can be automated to do repetative motions that the caster is practiced at doing, and trusted to do those tasks exactly as the caster would do them, as if controlled directly with no sensory feedback. Automated hands are not coordinated enough to make an attack, but could easily be used to assist in holding objects still, be set in motion to trigger a trap, or perform other repetative manual tasks like scrubbing or simple repetative craft work. If used for crafting, this spell can circumstantially add up to +1 to the craft check for every 3 caster levels (max +6) as an aid-another assistance bonus (does not stack with other sources of aid another).

## Arudion

**School** Necromancy; **Level** bard 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3

### Casting

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (a small rigid non-metal and inanimate object, life-essence of a living creature, and 5 gold coins, see text)

### Effect

**Range** personal, see text

**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object

**Duration** 1 hour per caster level (D)

### Description
As Lesser Arudion, with the following additions:
* If minimal in size: 5 hitpoints. Additional hitpoints and hardness are up to GM discretion.
* Can be made permanent as if it were Lesser Arudion, though a permanent device requires some form of power (e.g.: a light source nearby, heat, absorbing a spell level every few days, proximity to a sentient mind, or similar sources of loose energy)
* Linked range augmentation from the Lesser Arudion, typically measured in feet, is measured in miles instead. In addition, more complex messages can be sent with additional lag:
1 minute - a second of clearly audible sound, detectable by any another Arudion
10 minutes - a second of audible sound transmitted secretly to a specific Arudion
1 hour - a simple and clear image, as if drawn by hand, detectable by any another Arudion
10 hours - a simple and clear image, as if drawn by hand, transmitted secretly to a specific Arudion
* The Adurion can be triggered by a visible gesture (within line of sight) without fail (requires an additional gold coin)
* The Arudion can be programmed to press itself with the force of a mage hand, allowing it to move (roll or slide) under its own power at 15 feet per round, as long as that motion would not cause the Arudion to levitate. A linked Arudion triggered from a distance can only apply 1 lb of force once per round, or roll the Arudion at 5ft per round. (requires a gem valued at 25gp or more). each round of movement subtracts one round from duration.
* A linked Arudion can hear, very poorly, in real time, through another Arudion (add +10 circumstance penalty to hear through linked Arudions) requires a gem valued at 25gp or more.
* A linked Arudion can project hazy black-and-gray outlines on the flat surface of a gem, allowing the user to 'see' through the other Arudion, poorly, with a sight range of 5ft (add a +10 circumstance penelty to see through linked Arudions). requires a gem valued at 25gp or more.
* Arudions can be used as a source for a scry sensor without need for a scry roll, though any obstructing magic will affect the scry as normal. requires a gem valued at 10gp or more.

## Detect Dimensional Wake

**School** Divination; **Level** bard 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Target** a recent teleportation effect

**Duration** instantaneous (D)

### Description
Detect Dimensional Wake can determine what direction a teleport, dimension-door, or similar effect is headed toward, and the general range of the effect as an order-of-magnitude (as determined by the teleportation mischance table). The teleportation being analyzed needs to have started or ended within caster-level rounds, within the spell range.

---
## Area Channel

**School** Transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 4

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute per 5ft (D)

**Components** V, S, MF (Metal 1-inch diameter "channeling pipes")

### Effect

**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level), medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object

**Duration** 1 day per level (D)

### Description
Area Channel uses metal Chanelling Pipes to change the shape of an area-of-effect spell that effects a cubic-feet, cone, cylinder, or radius (spherical) emenation. Channeling Pipes must be of masterwork quality (100gp per 5ft), contiguously connected, with at least one source within the original area of effect. The type of spell effect being channeled must be specified when Area Channel is cast. The channeling pipe redistributes spell volume from the main emenation in 5ft cubed increments, to create a 5 cubic-ft cylinder of the target spell around or inside the pipe. The volume of the new emenation is subtracted from the original volume of the spell till all the volume is used, with excess spilling out uncontrolled evenly between the pipe exits. This can be used to turn a fireball into a line of fire up to 251 5ft-cubes long. 

---
## Teleportation Trace

**School** Divination; **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 4, witch 5

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Target** a recent teleportation effect

**Duration** 1 minute per level, instantaneous (D)

### Description
Teleportation Trace allows the caster to monitor teleporations in close range for 1 minute per level, as Detect Dimensional Wake. Addtionally, the caster can scry for 1 round to the point where a teleportation has started or ended. The teleportation being analyzed needs to have happened within caster-level rounds, within the range of the spell. 

---
## Interdiction Field

**School** Conjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 4, witch 5

### Casting

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (4ft of fine thread per ft^2 of target area)

### Effect

**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Target** 100 ft^2 + 10 ft^2 per level

**Duration** 1 hour per level (D)

### Description
Interdiction Field creates an invisible latice that blocks teleportation as the spell Dimensional Anchor. When the spell is cast, the area is identified, and strands of fine thread provided by the caster weave telekenetically into the area. Upon completion, the threads vaporize, and form barriers in adjacent planes (ethereal, shadow, astral) along the same path. For the duration of the spell, any teleportation or extra-planar travel through the Interdiction Field is halted, and the traveller is prevented from moving, or shunted to the nearest empty area on the same side of the barrier. Permanently extra-planar creatures, such as ghosts, can squeeze through the barrier. This spell can be made permanent with Permanency for 2,500 gp.

Ordinarily the duration of the effect is one hour per level, but duration is doubled if cast in metal pipes, metal bars, a wall of force, reliably flowing water, flowing air, or other similar predictable / intentional structures. The Interdiction Field becomes dependent on the intentional structure, and can be broken or repaired along with the structure. An Interdiction Field of this kind can be made permanent with Permanency at twice the target area.

---
## Metalshape

**School** Transmutation; **Level** bard 6, magus 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (soft clay)

### Effect

**Range** touch

**Target** stone or stone object touched, up to 10 cu. ft. + 1 cu. ft./level

**Duration** instantaneous or concentration up to 10 rounds. (D)

### Description
Metalshape functions as 10 consecutive rounds of stoneshape. It can also modify metal by dividing the amount shaped by 10. The spell can create fine details, including fine moving parts, contingent on an appropriate craft check (blacksmithing, sculpture, stonework, clockwork, ...). This spell can do 8 hours of appropriate crafting with stone or metal in the full 10 round duration. 8 hours of crafting can be hurried to less than 10 rounds to a minimum of 1 round by adding 5 to the craft DC for every skipped round. This effectively enables an entire day of crafting to be done in 5 rounds with a craft DC increase of +25, or practically instantly with a craft DC increase of +50.

---
## Violent Interdiction Field

**School** Conjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 6

### Casting

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (4ft of fine thread per ft^2 of target area)

### Effect

**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Effect** wall of ethereal whirling blades, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5 ft. per two levels

**Target** 100 ft^2 + 10 ft^2 per level

**Duration** 1 hour per level (D)

**Saving Throw**  Reflex half or Reflex negates

**Spell Resistance** yes

### Description
Similar to a Blade Barrier spell, any Ethereal/Shadow/Astral creature passing through the Violent Interdiction Field takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage. Teleporting creatures who make their Reflex save can choose to halt their teleportation at the Violent Interdiction Field instead of passing through it for half damage. Violent Interdiction can be made permanent at a cost of 7,000gp.

---
## Tenacious Enigma

**School** Abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7

### Casting

**Casting Time** standard action

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** see description

**Target** see description

**Duration** see description

### Description
Tenacious Enigma automatically re-applies a duration spell X number of times in sequence, where X is up to 1/4 caster level. This spell is designed to function with spells that can be made permanent with Permenancy, as well as illusion spells, abjuration spells, and mage's private sanctum. Each re-application is cast into a *spell cache* at the caster's convenience, using any metamagic feats or up-castings wished by the caster as normal. Tenacious Enigma automatically triggers cached castings, as though by a contingency spell, once the original duration is finished, or the original spell is dispelled. Instead of automatically reapplying after duration, subsequent spell castings can be set for rounds, minutes, days, or even decades after the previous casting expired (though not centuries). Any material costs associated with repeated spell casting must be paid when the spell is cast into the Tenacious Enigma spell cache. Spells that require concentration will only function if the caster is present and concentrating.

## Falsify Legend Lore

**School** Illusion; **Level** Bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7

### Casting

**Casting Time** See text

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** Unlimited

**Target** a subject

**Duration** Permanent

### Description
Permenantly causes Legend Lore or any other lower-level divination spell to return false information and false histories about the subject. Can be dispelled with another Falsify Legend Lore, only if a notable piece of the true history is known.

Casting this spell has similar requirements to Legend Lore. A bluff check is used to make the false legend seem as true as possible, though even if a false legend is disbelieved with a sufficient Sense Motive, the results of the Divination spell will not be improved.

---
## Teleport Interrogation

**School** Conjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6

### casting

**Casting Time** one full round

**Components** V, S, F (a polished glass prism worth 100gp)

### Effect

**Range** personal

**Target** a teleportation effect that occured days-per-level ago

**Duration** 1 minute per level

### Description
Enables the caster to 'see' the path of teleportation spells, and latch onto a specific path, which becomes the interrogated path. Once the interrogated path is chosen, the caster knows when the path was used, where the teleportation began and ended, and the size category of the subjects who passed through the path (possibly including details about their sillohette). For the duration of the spell, the caster can teleport along the interrogated path once per minute. The interrogated path can be any distance, through temporary or permanent gates, even extra planar. Paths to and through alternate planes are possibly subject to special rules, depending on the planes.

---
## Reality Obfuscation

**School** Abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level), medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** creature, object, or area (5ft/level sphere)

**Duration** 1 day per level (D)

### Description
Reality Obfuscation enchants a subject, an area (5ft-per-level radius sphere) or inanimate object, such that the object, or all objects and characters inside, are un-scryable by magical means. Divination spells made to discern anything inside the field will automatically fail. People who have interacted with the subject, object, or spent time in the field must succeed in a will save or be unable to directly mention the target subject/object(s) while the spell is active. The effect preventing free-expression-of-thought is similar to an attack blocked by a Sanctuary spell. At the end of the spell's duration, anyone familiar with the object, who was not specifically excluded at the time of original casting, must roll a will-save, or permanently lose one step of familiarity with the subject/object(s) (See levels of the Teleport spell table, or 5 DC of the Scrying table). The duration of the spell can be set to less than it's maximum duration on casting.

## Change Race, Minor

**School** Transmutation; **Level** druid 6, witch 6

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (500 gp diamond dust) (D)

### Effect

**Range** touch

**Target** one friendly creature

**Save** Fortitude partial

**Spell Resistance** Yes

**Duration** days per caster level

### Description
The caster starts a biological process that morphs the target into a different *sub-race of their same species*, which takes 1 hour to complete. After the spell's duration, the target spends 1 hour involuntarily morphing back into their original form. This spell can instead be made permanent to a living creature with a permanency spell for 7,500gp. The target loses any racial bonuses and penalties of their old race, and gains racial penalties and bonuses of their new race. Age is transfered biologically proportional rather chronologically proportional. If the target attempts a fortitude save against the spell and succeeds, they are nauseated for one round. This spell can also be used to change the target into a yet-unknown subrace, with a skin color of choice, as well as other cosmetic differences (non cosmetic racial traits must be validated with the game master). Durable cosmetic changes (like different eye/nose/ear shape, hair type, body shape) can be used to give a +5 to disguise checks.

---
## Change Race, Lesser

This spell can instead be made permanent to a living creature with a permanency spell for 7,500gp. The target loses any racial bonuses and penalties of their old race, and gains racial penalties and bonuses of their new race. Any racial bonuses that are choice-dependent must resolve during the involuntary morph. Age is transfered biologically proportional rather chronologically proportional. If the target attempts a fortitude save against the spell and succeeds, they are nauseated for one round.

Those rhymed words will follow the target until the spell expires or resolves, and can be magically recognized by others using True Seeing, mind reading spells, or other divination intended to peer into the soul or recognize reality. The dungeon master resolves effects.

### Description

**A Work In Progress**

This spell appears to be a work in progress, with annotations indicating that the spell was re-written in a more complete form elsewhere. The spell's goal seems to be to shift the caster and one additional creature per 4 caster levels through reality, weaving their physical form and essence through the metaphorical threads binding the planes, eventually to escape reality, and re-emerge elsewhere. Its most mundane use would allow instant travel to any location on any plane, with high precision. But, it could also very easily, and accidentally, take the traveller to entirely new forms of existence. This spell is used for [travelling the multiverse](https://youtu.be/FkXlKQS5Elo?t=83).

Even casting the spell requires incredible magical circumstances, like a specialized artifact that can channel magical energy beyond mortal limits, or a powerful ritual to drastically expand caster level and ability.

The spell requires a teleportation circle of some kind, drawn in stiff and dense material, but the details of the circle, including its shape and specific materials used to draw it, seem to be in a state of iteration. A careful reading of the spell indicates that travel has a better chance to succeed when the target 'location' (defined as a 7 dimensional position, x/y/z/plane/time/fate/reality) is marked by a dramatic fate-changing landmark event, ideally intimately known to the caster.

Requires an "impossible" Knowledge Arcana or Spellcraft (DC60) to complete the spell, after at least 5 days of research and development. The spell DC can be circumstantially reduced with access to relevant rare books related to extra-planar travel, the multiverse, and/or god-like control over existence.

**What the Spell Does**

Existence Shift pulls the traveller into a bubble of quasi-habitable space in a winding cavern, of unbounded length, branching in every direction, that is simultaneously impossibly dark, and bursting with the light of untold realities cutting paths into every void the traveller encounters.

Travelling the path of Existence Shift could be a means to time travel, or to achieve godhood, or irretrievable abandonment deep in the void of the dark tapestry, or a path to direct encounter with great-old-ones. Without proper caution, the most likely outcome is utter annihilation in a dark emptiness that exists beyond reach of the astral plane and the river of souls, resulting in a final and irrevocable loss of all states of being.

**What the Spell Caster and Companion Target Does**

Travelling the path requires constant Existence checks, which are simultaneous reflex and will saves DC12, once per minute, to prevent a collapse into the endless void under shimmering and shifting shards of reality. Without a clear destination to travel toward, travellers will absolutely fall into a black void, never to be seen again. With a clear destination, travellers must make Travel checks: a Count of 10 successful DC30 stat bonus checks, of random kind (roll 1d20, 1-3: str, 4-6: dex, 7-9: con, 10-12: int, 13-15: wis, 16-18: cha, 19-20: traveller's choice), one per minute, modified by the following table:

| Count | DC | Condition of the starting/ending points of the path |
| --- | --- | ---|
|	-1|	-3| At least one monumentous event occured at or near (within 400ft and 10 minutes) the ending point (in 7 dimensional space). Momentus is defined by the caster's perspective. |
|	-1|	-3| The traveller remembers the location and time of the ending point, or forsaw the the location and time in a vision|
|	-1|	-3|	The traveller took first-hand notes of the end point, suffered a highly memorable or traumatic event there, or experienced it recently
|	-1|	-2|	The path's starting and ending points are at roughly the same position in time
|	-1|	-2|	The path's starting and ending points are on the same plane
|	-1|	-2|	The path's starting and ending points are at roughly the same position in physical space
|	-1|	-2|	The traveller is not expecting to be the same being when they emerge at the end point (may have character consequences, GM discretion)
|	-1|	-2|	The traveller is not expecting the rules of reality to be the same when they emerge at the end point (will have gameplay consequences, GM discretion)
|	-1|	-2| Another monumentous event occured at or near (within 100 miles or 8 hours) the ending point (in 7 dimensional space) |
|	0|	-2|	The specific end point location has no sentient beings observing it for 1 minute before time of arrival
|	0|	-2|	The traveller recently read first-hand notes of an event at the destination, or discussed it with other witnesses
|	0|	-2|	The traveller has at least one companion traveller who remembers the destination or forsaw it in a vision
|	0|	-2|	The traveller has been ordered by a cosmic authority (CR20 or higher) to arrive at the intended destination
|	0|	+2|	The traveller has been sentient for more than 1000 years, including sleep (may apply more than once, for each 1000 years)
|	0|	+3|	The traveller is or has been undead
|	0|	+3|	The traveller has been resurrected from the dead (may apply more than once)
|	0|	+3|	The traveller is a soulless construct
|	+1|	-2|	It is existentially important to the traveller that they arrive at the intended destination
|	+1|	+2|	The traveller is not native to the prime material plane
|	+1|	0|	The destination point has a specific and foreign/different law of reality to the starting point (may apply more than once)
|	+1|	+2|	The traveller wishes to emerge at their destination with some change to their own reality (equivalent to casting Wish once, may apply more than once)
|	+1|	+3|	The traveller is a mindless construct, being controlled remotely

Additional modifiers are up to GM discretion.

Failing any Existence or Travel checks results in a travel mishap. As soon as a mishap happens, roll a d100 and use the following table to determine the effect:

| &nbsp;d100&nbsp; |effect|
| --- | --- |
|01-50|disappear into the ultimate void beyond existence|
|51-56|disappear, summoned by a great old one, to be eaten, in an unknown location in space and time.
|57-58|disappear, cursed to stay outside of existence as an astral ghost, travelling space and time, seeing reality without ever interacting with it again.
|59-60|disappear to a random location/time in the the plane of earth
|61-62|disappear to a random location/time in the the plane of fire
|63-64|disappear to a random location/time in the the plane of air
|65-66|disappear to a random location/time in the the plane of water
|67-68|disappear to a random location/time in the astral plane
|69-70|become posessed by an astral ghost, reroll your Existence or Travel check
|71-72|disappear to a random location/time in the the positive energy plane, where you will likely be immediately incinerated by radiant fire
|73-74|disappear to a random location/time in the the negative energy plane, where you will likely be immediately vaporized by the necrotic void
|75-76|disappear to a random location/time in the the fey wilds
|77-78|disappear to a random location/time in a plane of the abyss
|79-80|disappear to a random location/time in elysium
|81-82|disappear to a random location/time in a random demiplane
|83-85|disappear to a random location/time in the sky or atmosphere of a random habitable world
|86-87|disappear to a random location/time underwater or underground on a random habitable world
|88-90|disappear to a random location/time at sea level or on the surface of a random habitable world
|91-97|disappear to some interpolated location between your starting position and desired ending position
|98-99|disappear to a random location/time in the material plane, in the vacuum of space
|100|GM Choice

Luckily, only the leader of the group travelling through existence must discern the distortion of the path by making random stat checks to choose the correct path through the spell. Followers can make the same checks using any stat, rolling all 6 for each check and chosing which ever is highest, with a +2 bonus. If the leader guiding multiple targets fails and disappears, the group must instantly know who to follow as the next leader or be forced to individually make the rest of their own travel checks as their own leader.

**Movement and Spells Within Existence Shift**

The bubble of reality moving with travellers allows untyped movement of 30ft per round, though movement through space is meaningless during Existence Shift. Many spells continue to function as normal, though some spells and abilities are meaningless during Existence Shift (GM discretion). As travellers warp themselves through the void outside of existence, only time spent within the path and intentional destination are relevant. Moving across the spell's duration causes a traveller's sense of presence and time to continuously change as their soul(s) pass through alternate realities, resulting in distortion of self and consciousness, as though going from dream to dream, as well as distorted perception of travelling partners.

Successfully travelling through Existence Shift makes no guarantee that a return trip is possible, since the paths through reality are inconsistent. A return trip to the exact starting point requires either another complete casting of Existence Shift, or a chain of watchers, observing from the starting-point to the destination holding the path open. Watchers can be fellow travellers or even observant constructs, maintaining a path through Existence Shift by observation.

**Maintaining a Return Path**

Watching an Existence Shift path intentionally is an action (standard or move action) within the spell. It keeps the path open and known, and must be done uninterrupted (once per round) from the starting point to the ending point to maintain a path back. A group of watchers, spaced out like bread crumbs in a maze, would have to maintain an observant presence at each minute-mark (or closer) of the path in order to be followed by another traveller. Halting at a specific point on the path causes time to apparently cease for the watcher, though the path continues to warp around them anyway. Watchers further apart than 1 minute increments on the path are impossible to perceive as guides, and will render the path untraversable.

Watchers maintaining the path must survive the constant shifting and splitting realities, making DC12 will and reflex Existence checks each minute, up to the duration of the spell. Remotely controlled construct watchers have their will save done by the controller. While watching the path and neighboring watchers, the paths themselves will drift: watchers may move further apart or closer together while standing still, possibly even losing sight of a neighboring watcher or mistaking them for a functionally equivalent one from a similar branched reality. Immobile observant objects (constructs that do not move) marking the path will fail to adjust for drift, and lose the path within 1d10 minutes.

**Dangers of Existence Shift**

If travellers holding an Existence Shift path open do not make it back to the Existence Shift path before the spell duration is over, their path back will be lost, and only another casting and successful navigation of Existence Shift can bring travellers back to their starting point (or a similar reality).

Some spirits and astral beings may be sensitive (notably [Bythos](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/aeon/aeon-bythos)) to open portals through existence, so it is wise to use this spell as descretely as possible. Some of these beings may be invisible, or extremely difficult to detect.

An astral spirit infiltrating an Existence Shift spell may be able to:
* Emerge into the start or destination point of the Existence Shift
* Phase into a traveller's bubble of reality to attack them during travel
* Posess or merge with a traveller on the path, which may be permanent
