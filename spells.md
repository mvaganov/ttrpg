## Arudion, Lesser

**School** Necromancy; **Level** magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, summoner 1, witch 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (a small rigid non-metal and inanimate object, life-essence of a living creature like blood/sweat/tears, 1 gold coin, see text)

### Effect

**Range** personal, see text

**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object

**Duration** 1 hour per caster level (D)

### Description
An Arudion is a rigid non-metal inanimate object (a pebble, piece of wood, stiff paper, ...), imbued with a shadow of life, which is enslaved into the rigid medium by magically etched gold runes. The Arudion is enchanted to do an action, or "programmed", by these runes during casting.
A programmed Arudion can activated with a carefully worded contingency. Easily programmed contingencies include a command-word, a physical pressing or swiping, or activation of another specific Arudion.
A simple describable event can be used as a trigger, with failure chance at GM discretion. Arudions can be linked together during programming, which allows them trigger other physically or remotely linked Arudions up to a certain range. These triggers have a delay, or "lag", up to GM discretion.
Arudion functionality can be augmented by including additional resources when crafting the spell:

* emit light (as light cantrip) - requires a gem valued at 5gp or more. Light emitted is the color of the gem.
* emit sound (as ghost sound) - requires an additional gold coin.
* vibrate gently in specific patterns - requires an additional gold coin. every second of vibration reduces the duration by an additional second.
* ability to link to other Arudions with a wire or string - requires an additional gold coin
* wireless link - 5gp gem: short range link (25ft + 2ft per 2 casterlevels), 25gp gem: medium range link (100ft + 10ft per caster level), 100gp gem: long range link (400ft + 40ft per level). The wireless signal that communicates between Arudions can be blocked by a metal box, and could fail if many other Arudions are messaging each other simultaneously, at the discretion of the GM. The complexity of the message limits how quickly it can travel wirelessly between Arudions.
instant - the presence or absence of *any* message from *any* Arudion can be determined instantly
1 round - the presence or absense of a message from a specific Arudion
1 round - transmitting the equivalent of 1 word wirelessly
1 minute - transmitting the equivalent of 1 word wirelessly in a way that is difficult for any arudion that is not the intended recipient to detect
Conditions may arise that add additional time cost to messaging per GM discretion.

A finished Arudion made of minimal materials has 1 hitpoint, and ceases to function after it loses that hitpoint from damage. Additional hitpoints are determined by materials used, crafting skill, and GM discretion. An Arudion can be made permanent with Permenancy for 2,500gp. An expired (but not destroyed or broken) Arudion whose duration has finished can have it's duration restarted by casting Lesser Arudion into it, ignoring the initial material component costs.

## Analyze Spell Cast

**School** Divination; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

### Casting

**Casting Time** standard action

**Components** V, S, M (1 gp diamond dust)

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Target** a source of magic or spell effect

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description
Analyze Spell Cast Determines the spell level of a persistent spell (within 1d4 levels), possibly the alignment of the caster, how long ago the spell was cast (by category: less than 1 minute, less than 1 day, less than one month, less than one year, or power-of-10 years). Works on magical items. Probably written by House of Vecna.

## Data Breach

**School** Divination; **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (1 gp diamond dust)

### Effect

**Range** touch

**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object

**Duration** 1 round per level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes

### Description
Creates a 'divination hole' emminating from a finger-print sized portion of the object touched. The hole emits a bright magical light visible with any divination spell, including level 0 cantrips/orisons. The light shines and 'vibrates' in a way that allows scrying and divination to tunnel through magical fields that would otherwise prevent scrying. Any basic divination done while looking at the divination-hole (by the caster of the divination hole) automatically succeeds any caster-level checks, allowing at least partial truth to be discerned (like spell school, when a spell was cast, what kind of caster cast the spell, an estimate of spell duration), even from deep obfuscating magics.

---
## Arcane Collaboration

**School** Abjuration; **Level** bard 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level), medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** up to 1 + 1 / 3 levels friendly targets

**Duration** 1 hour per level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description
This spell allows the caster to share control of a spell to up to 1 + lvl/3 other casters with sufficiently high casting scores. The effect lasts 1hr per level, or until the shared spell expires.

---
## Mage Clamps

**School** Transmutation; **Level** bard 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one non-magical, unattended object weighing up to 5 lbs. per 3 caster levels (max 5)

**Duration** 1 hour per caster level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

### Description
The caster creates multiple mage hands, which persist without concentration, though they will wink out of existence if the caster moves beyond the spell range or falls unconscious. Each hand can be moved manually, one hand per round, as a normal magehand. In addition, each hand can be automated to do repetative motions that the caster is practiced at doing, and trusted to do those tasks exactly as the caster would do them, as if controlled directly with no sensory feedback. Automated hands are not coordinated enough to make an attack, but could easily be used to assist in holding objects still, be set in motion to trigger a trap, or perform other repetative manual tasks like scrubbing or simple repetative craft work. If used for crafting, this spell can circumstantially add up to +1 to the craft check for every 3 caster levels (max +6) as an aid-another assistance bonus (does not stack with other sources of aid another).

## Arudion

**School** Necromancy; **Level** bard 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3

### Casting

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (a small rigid non-metal and inanimate object, life-essence of a living creature, and 5 gold coins, see text)

### Effect

**Range** personal, see text

**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object

**Duration** 1 hour per caster level (D)

### Description
As Lesser Arudion, with the following additions:
* If minimal in size: 5 hitpoints. Additional hitpoints and hardness are up to GM discretion.
* Can be made permanent as if it were Lesser Arudion, though a permanent device requires some form of power (e.g.: a light source nearby, heat, absorbing a spell level every few days, proximity to a sentient mind, or similar sources of loose energy)
* Linked range augmentation from the Lesser Arudion, typically measured in feet, is measured in miles instead. In addition, more complex messages can be sent with additional lag:
1 minute - a second of clearly audible sound
10 minutes - a second of audible sound transmitted secretly
1 hour - a simple and clear image, as if drawn by hand
10 hours - a simple and clear image, as if drawn by hand, transmitted secretly
* The Adurion can be triggered by a visible gesture (within line of sight) without fail (requires an additional gold coin)
* The Arudion can be programmed to press itself with the force of a mage hand, allowing it to move (roll or slide) under its own power at 15 feet per round, as long as that motion would not cause the Arudion to levitate. A linked Arudion triggered from a distance can only apply 1 lb of force once per round, or roll the Arudion at 5ft per round. (requires a gem valued at 25gp or more). each round of movement subtracts one round from duration.
* A linked Arudion can hear, very poorly, in real time, through another Arudion (add +10 circumstance penalty to hear through linked Arudions) requires a gem valued at 25gp or more.
* A linked Arudion can project hazy black-and-gray outlines on the flat surface of a gem, allowing the user to 'see' through the other Arudion, poorly, with a sight range of 5ft (add a +10 circumstance penelty to see through linked Arudions). requires a gem valued at 25gp or more.
* Arudions can be used as a source for a scry sensor without need for a scry roll, though any obstructing magic will affect the scry as normal. requires a gem valued at 10gp or more.

## Detect Dimensional Wake

**School** Divination; **Level** bard 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Target** a recent teleportation effect

**Duration** instantaneous (D)

### Description
Detect Dimensional Wake can determine what direction a teleport, dimension-door, or similar effect is headed toward, and the general range of the effect as an order-of-magnitude (as determined by the teleportation mischance table). The teleportation being analyzed needs to have started or ended within caster-level rounds, within the spell range.

---
## Area Channel

**School** Transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 4

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute per 5ft (D)

**Components** V, S, MF (Metal 1-inch diameter "channeling pipes")

### Effect

**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level), medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** a pebble, tablet, or other small rigid and inanimate object

**Duration** 1 day per level (D)

### Description
Area Channel uses metal Chanelling Pipes to change the shape of an area-of-effect spell that effects a cubic-feet, cone, cylinder, or radius (spherical) emenation. Channeling Pipes must be of masterwork quality (100gp per 5ft), contiguously connected, with at least one source within the original area of effect. The type of spell effect being channeled must be specified when Area Channel is cast. The channeling pipe redistributes spell volume from the main emenation in 5ft cubed increments, to create a 5 cubic-ft cylinder of the target spell around or inside the pipe. The volume of the new emenation is subtracted from the original volume of the spell till all the volume is used, with excess spilling out uncontrolled evenly between the pipe exits. This can be used to turn a fireball into a line of fire up to 251 5ft-cubes long.

## Teleportation Trace

**School** Divination; **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 4, witch 5

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Target** a recent teleportation effect

**Duration** 1 minute per level, instantaneous (D)

### Description
Teleportation Trace allows the caster to monitor teleporations in close range for 1 minute per level, as Detect Dimensional Wake. Addtionally, the caster can scry for 1 round to the point where a teleportation has started or ended. The teleportation being analyzed needs to have happened within caster-level rounds, within the range of the spell.

## Interdiction Field

**School** Conjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 4, witch 5

### Casting

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (4ft of fine thread per ft^2 of target area)

### Effect

**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Target** 100 ft^2 + 10 ft^2 per level

**Duration** 1 hour per level (D)

### Description
Interdiction Field creates an invisible latice that blocks teleportation as the spell Dimensional Anchor. When the spell is cast, the area is identified, and strands of fine thread provided by the caster weave telekenetically into the area. Upon completion, the threads vaporize, and form barriers in adjacent planes (ethereal, shadow, astral) along the same path. For the duration of the spell, any teleportation or extra-planar travel through the Interdiction Field is halted, and the traveller is prevented from moving, or shunted to the nearest empty area on the same side of the barrier. Permanently extra-planar creatures, such as ghosts, can squeeze through the barrier. This spell can be made permanent with Permanency for 2,500 gp.

Ordinarily the duration of the effect is one hour per level, but duration is doubled if cast in metal pipes, metal bars, a wall of force, reliably flowing water, flowing air, or other similar predictable / intentional structures. The Interdiction Field becomes dependent on the intentional structure, and can be broken or repaired along with the structure. An Interdiction Field of this kind can be made permanent with Permanency at twice the target area.

## Metalshape

**School** Transmutation; **Level** bard 6, magus 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (soft clay)

### Effect

**Range** touch

**Target** stone or stone object touched, up to 10 cu. ft. + 1 cu. ft./level

**Duration** instantaneous or concentration up to 10 rounds. (D)

### Description
Metalshape functions as 10 consecutive rounds of stoneshape. It can also modify metal by dividing the amount shaped by 10. The spell can create fine details, including fine moving parts, contingent on an appropriate craft check (blacksmithing, sculpture, stonework, clockwork, ...). This spell can do 8 hours of appropriate crafting with stone or metal in the full 10 round duration. 8 hours of crafting can be hurried to less than 10 rounds to a minimum of 1 round by adding 5 to the craft DC for every skipped round. This effectively enables an entire day of crafting to be done in 5 rounds with a craft DC increase of +25, or practically instantly with a craft DC increase of +50.

## Violent Interdiction Field

**School** Conjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 6

### Casting

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (4ft of fine thread per ft^2 of target area)

### Effect

**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Effect** wall of ethereal whirling blades, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5 ft. per two levels

**Target** 100 ft^2 + 10 ft^2 per level

**Duration** 1 hour per level (D)

**Saving Throw**  Reflex half or Reflex negates

**Spell Resistance** yes

### Description
Similar to a Blade Barrier spell, any Ethereal/Shadow/Astral creature passing through the Violent Interdiction Field takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage. Teleporting creatures who make their Reflex save can choose to halt their teleportation at the Violent Interdiction Field instead of passing through it for half damage. Can be made permanent as Violent Interdiction, at a cost of 7,000gp.

## Tenacious Enigma

**School** Abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7

### Casting

**Casting Time** standard action

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** see description

**Target** see description

**Duration** see description

### Description
Tenacious Enigma automatically re-applies a duration spell X number of times in sequence, where X is up to 1/4 caster level. This spell is designed to function with spells that can be made permanent with Permenancy, as well as illusion spells, abjuration spells, and mage's private sanctum. Each re-application is cast into a spell *cache* at the caster's convenience, using any metamagic feats or up-castings wished by the caster as normal. Tenacious Enigma automatically triggers cached castings, as though by a contingency spell, once the original duration is finished, or the original spell is dispelled. Instead of automatically reapplying after duration, subsequent spell castings can be set for rounds, minutes, days, or even decades after the previous casting expired (though not centuries). Any material costs associated with repeated spell casting must be paid when Tenacious Enigma is cast, along with the required spell castings themselves. Spells that require concentration will only function if the caster is present.

## Falsify Legend Lore

**School** Illusion; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7

### Casting

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** Unlimited

**Target** a subject

**Duration** 1 hour per level (D)

---
## Teleport Interrogation

**School** Conjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6

### casting

**Casting Time** one full round

**Components** V, S, F (a polished glass prism worth 100gp)

### Effect

**Range** personal

**Target** a teleportation effect that occured days-per-level ago

**Duration** 1 minute per level

### Description
Enables the caster to 'see' the path of teleportation spells, and latch onto a specific path, which becomes the interrogated path. Once the interrogated path is chosen, the caster knows when the path was used, where the teleportation began and ended, and the size category of the subjects who passed through the path (possibly including details about their sillohette). For the duration of the spell, the caster can teleport along the interrogated path once per minute. The interrogated path can be any distance, through temporary or permanent gates, even extra planar. Paths to and through alternate planes are possibly subject to special rules, depending on the planes.

---
## Reality Obfuscation

**School** Abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** personal, touch, close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level), medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level), long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** creature, object, or area (5ft/level sphere)

**Duration** 1 day per level (D)

### Description
Reality Obfuscation enchants a subject, an area (5ft-per-level radius sphere) or inanimate object, such that the object, or all objects and characters inside, are un-scryable by magical means. Divination spells made to discern anything inside the field will automatically fail. People who have interacted with the subject, object, or spent time in the field must succeed in a will save or be unable to directly mention the target subject/object(s) while the spell is active. The effect preventing free-expression-of-thought is similar to an attack blocked by a Sanctuary spell. At the end of the spell's duration, anyone familiar with the object, who was not specifically excluded at the time of original casting, must roll a will-save, or permanently lose one step of familiarity with the subject/object(s) (See levels of the Teleport spell table, or 5 DC of the Scrying table). The duration of the spell can be set to less than it's maximum duration on casting.

**School** Divination; **Level** druid 4, witch 4

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

### Effect

**Range** personal

**Target** a network of plants

**Duration** Concentration up to 1 minute per caster level

### Description
The caster can channel senses (sight/sound/smell) through plants, and jump a sensor from plant to plant, using physically connected roots or foliage in line of sight. The travelling sensor can move along plants at 1km per level per round, 1m per level per round, or 1 cm per level per round. Perception DCs increased by +1 per 100*casterlevel meters.

## Change Race, Minor

**School** Transmutation; **Level** druid 6, witch 6

### Casting

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (500 gp diamond dust) (D)

### Effect

**Range** touch

**Target** one friendly creature

**Save** Fortitude partial

**Spell Resistance** Yes

**Duration** days per caster level

### Description
The caster starts a biological process that morphs the target into a different sub-race of their same species, which takes 1 hour to complete. After the spell's duration, the target spends 1 hour involuntarily morphing back into their original form. This spell can instead be made permanent with a permanency spell for 7,500gp. The target loses any racial bonuses and penalties of their old race, and gains racial penalties and bonuses of their new race. Age is transfered biologically proportional rather chronologically proportional. If the target attempts a fortitude save against the spell and succeeds, they are nauseated for one round. This spell can also be used to change the target into a yet-unknown subrace, with a skin color of choice, as well as other cosmetic differences (non cosmetic racial traits must be validated with the game master). Durable cosmetic changes (like different eye/nose/ear shape, hair type, body shape) can be used to give a +5 to disguise checks.
